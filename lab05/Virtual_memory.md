## What is virtual memory
* Definition: Virtual memory is a memory management technique used by operating systems to give the appearance of a large, continuous block of memory to applications, even if the physical memory (RAM) is limited and not necessarily allocated in contiguous manner
* Simplified: Virtual memory is a **memory managerment** technique use by OS to make a computer appear to have more memory than it physically does

## Characteristic
### Physical memory
* Main memory - hardware - RAM

### Virtual memory
* Abstract layer - created by operating system
* operating system use to manage process memory
* Processes can only access virtual memory
* Operating system will mapping virtual memory -> physical memory

## Why do we need virtual memory
Virtual memory concept was invented to solve problems:
* Not enough memory
* Memory fragmentation
* Security

### Not enough memory
By using virtual memory, only part of a program is kept in RAM at a time. When more data is needed than RAM can hold, the operating system swaps some pages out to disk (swap space), and brings in the needed pages.

### Memory fragmentation
* Virtual memory divides both physical RAM and process memory into small fixed-size blocks called pages (usually 4 KB).
* When a program requests memory, it doesnâ€™t need one large continuous block. Its pages can be scattered all over physical RAM.
* Everything will be keeping track by page table

### Security
By using mapping them to corresponding physical address, it would't override each other.

## Additional detail: Optional header
* BaseOfCode: RVA (related virtual address) of start of the code section when the file is loaded into memory
* ImageBase: It is the address in virtual memory where the executable should be loaded at
* AddressOfEntryPoint: RVA of entry point. Entry point is a pointer to the entry point function, relative to the image base address. It points to the instruction where execution starts
* SizeOfStack:
  * Reserve: the address space is allocated within the process that requested it
  * Commit: mapping that address space to the physical memory so that it can be used.
