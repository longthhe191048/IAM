Disassemble with `IDA` and look at `WinMain`

we can see 2 register holding 2 variable: `ecx = 0x1e` and `eax = lt.systemtime` or our time in the machine, after that it calculate the remaining days by `sub` instruction. So i decided to modified it like below
```
add     ecx, ecx
```
This should result in `30 + 30 = 60 days`
